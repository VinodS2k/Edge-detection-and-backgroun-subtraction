# Edge-detection-and-background-subtraction


short Boundary Detection is a technique used in computer vision to identify shorter edges or boundaries in an image. This is particularly useful for focusing on specific regions within an image, such as detecting objects or features in dynamic scenes1.

Background Subtraction involves separating the foreground objects from the background in a video or image sequence. This technique is widely used in applications like surveillance, motion detection, and gesture recognition2. It works by comparing each frame with a background model and classifying pixels as either background or foreground based on their similarity to the model.

Image Segmentation by Clustering Pixels
Image Segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions based on the characteristics of the pixels. Clustering is a technique used to group similar pixels together. Common clustering algorithms for image segmentation include:

K-Means Clustering: This method partitions the image into K clusters based on pixel similarity, such as color or intensity. Each pixel is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean value4.

Agglomerative Clustering: This hierarchical method starts with each pixel as its own cluster and iteratively merges the closest clusters until only one cluster remains.

Divisive Clustering: This hierarchical method starts with all pixels in one cluster and recursively splits the cluster into smaller clusters until each pixel is in its own cluster.

These techniques help in identifying and isolating different objects or regions within an image, making it easier to analyze and process
